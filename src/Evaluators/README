Header files contain inlined functions for force and energy computations.

Cuda files are solely for declaring exports to the python interface.

These exports are made available to the python interface only for 
development testing, and must not be used in production simulations.
As such, these exports and usages are documented via the test suite, 
and are not in the user guide.

Do not use the exported Evaluators for simulations; for production simulations, 
use Fixes (which then call these Evaluators).
