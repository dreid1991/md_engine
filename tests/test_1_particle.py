#  test_1_particle.py
#
#  This file considers a series of basic tests with a single particle to verify that the most
#  basic features are correct.
#  It also verifies that force and energies from wall potentials and external fields are correct.
#
#  Author: Brian Keene
#
#  Tests:
#
#       test_1_particle_potential_1():
#              a particle initialized in some potential well with kinetic energy less than
#              the potential well depth stays in that well
#
#       test_1_particle_potential_2():
#              a particle initialized in some potential well with kinetic energy greater than
#              the potential well depth exits that well; given knowledge of the depth of the well,
#              we can assert the remaining kinetic energy in the absence of the potential
#
#       test_1_particle_fixExternalHarmonic():
#
#       test_1_particle_EvaluatorExternalHarmonic():
#
#       test_1_particle_fixExternalQuartic():
#
#       test_1_particle_EvaluatorExternalQuartic():
#
#       test_1_particle_fixWallLJ126():
#
#       test_1_particle_EvaluatorWallLJ126():
#              analytically verifies that the EvaluatorWallLJ126 returns proper force and energy
